The Flickr Searcher app utilizes the Flickr API to allow the user to search for images hosted on the Flickr site using a single keyword, or multiple keywords, and returns to the user images tagged with those keywords, as well as the caption given to the images by the Flicker user, if any.  

A live version of the app can be found here: bpcoxjr.github.io/flickr-searcher/.
